#### Part B 获取扫描状态参数 `int GetStatus**()`   data type:TIntStatus

- *statusApproachState:* returns ***immediately*** the Approach State (whether the tip is approaching or engaged) for STM, AFM, and AC AFM, where  0 is not approaching and 1 is approaching. 

-  *statusScanLine:* returns the scan line where the scan has stopped for STM, AFM, and AC AFM. Scan line DOES update during scanning. The following return behavior should be noted:

- - Scan lines are 0 index based. Thus, a resolution of 16 in X gives scan line limits of 0 to 15.
    - These scan line limits are only returned at the scan bottom and top turnarounds. For example, when the scan continues at the bottom and top of the scan area, the return values for scan line limits are 0 and 15, respectively.
    - When the scan stops at the bottom or top of the scan area, the return scan line is  one less than the mentioned limits. For example, for a scan which stops at the bottom, the return value is 1; and, for a stop at the top, the return value is 14.

- *statusScanPixel:* returns the pixel where the scan has stopped for STM, AFM, and AC AFM. Pixel DOES NOT update during scanning--updates when scan stops.

- *statusScanLineHeld:* returns the line which 'Hold Slow' holds the tip  for STM, AFM, and AC AFM. Returns -1 when Hold Slow is not active

### 获取扫描参数

#### Part A TDoubleScanParameter   `  double GetScanSize( )`

- *scanSize:* Reads the x and y scan range by the same amount. The range is limited by the scanner parameters. This value has meters for units. 
- *scanXOffset:* Reads x-postion of the reduced scan range within the maximum allowable scan range
- *scanYOffset:* Reads y-postion of the reduced scan range within the maximum allowable scan range
- *scanSpeed:* Reads the scan speed. There are only certain allowable scan speeds which are Max/n, where n = 1, 2,3...).
- *scanAngle:* Reads the orientation of the reduced scan range by rotating it in degrees. Positive values rotate the image area clockwise
- *scanXOverscan:* For the x-axis, scans a percentage of the viewable scan area. This region is not viewed in the image buffer.
- *ScanYOverscan:* For the y-axis, scans a percentage of the viewable scan area. This region is not viewed in the image buffer.
- *scanXServoIGain:* Applies integral gain to the closed loop x-sensor. This has the effect of controlling the feedbackloop based on its history
- *scanXServoPGain:* Applies Proportional gain to the closed loop x-sensor. This has the effect of controlling the feedbackloop based on its current status
- *scanYServoIGain:* Applies integral gain to the closed loop y-sensor. This has the effect of controlling the feedbackloop based on its history
- *scanYServoPGain:* Applies Proportional gain to the closed loop y-sensor. This has the effect of controlling the feedbackloop based on its current status
- *scanTipSpeed:* tip speed in meters/second when moved in x or y. Used with SetTipPositon function.

#### Part B TIntScanParameter    `  int GetScanSize( )`

- *scanXPixels:* The number of pixels for the X axis. The actual number of pixels is one greater than this value (eg, 512 pixels are coded as 511)..
- *scanYPixels:* The number of pixels for the Y axis. The actual number of pixels is one greater than this value (eg, 512 pixels are coded as 511)..
- *scanFrames:* Reads the number of frames which will be scanned.

#### Part C  TBoolScanParameter     `Bool GetScanSize( )`

- *scanTipLift:* Lifts the tip when the reduced scan area is moved more than half its X or Y length
- *scanHoldSlow:* Holds the tip in Y (tip doesn't move in the y-coordinate) and scans in x
- *scanXYServoActive:* Enables or disables the XY closed loop servo control.
- *scanAutoSave:* Enables or disables image autosave.

#### 示例代码

```python
import picoscript

print "ScanSize: ", picoscript.GetScanSize()
print "ScanXOffset: ", picoscript.GetScanXOffset()
print "ScanYOffset: ", picoscript.GetScanYOffset()
```
